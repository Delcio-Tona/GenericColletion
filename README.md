# Part2
The app allows users to enter an unlimited number of recipes.

Users can enter additional details for each ingredient, including the number of calories and the food group it belongs to.

Users can view a list of all recipes in alphabetical order and choose a recipe to display its details.

The application calculates and displays the total calories of each recipe, if the calories exceed 300 calories a warning is displayed.

This time we use generic collections (List<T>) for better understanding, which are used to store recipes, ingredients and steps, providing flexibility and efficiency in the application.

A unit test design is added to ensure the correctness of the total calorie calculation logic, increasing the reliability of the application.

There is not too much that I have to change.
So, the first one is: Structured somewhat well, with some comments. 
* Now I wrote more comments, I explained more about the code.
Second: No readme file is included, or the readme file doesn't provide any helpful information about running the application. The readme file contains information about running the app, but it is hard to understand or doesn't work.
* Now the readme file is included with more helpful information about how to running the application.
